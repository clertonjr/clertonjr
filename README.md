I started my professional career in the area of ​​Technology when I studied Information Systems. I worked in professional schools in the state of Ceará, where I came to occupy the roles of Coordinator, Teacher and Internship Advisor in Object Oriented Programming subjects; Computer Architecture and Maintenance; Programming for WEB (JAVA); Computer network; Structured Cabling; Operational systems; Systems Analysis; Programming logic; Hardware Installation.

I have developed projects aimed at the development of young professionals leading to digital inclusion at the best age and various jobs for the development of skills and abilities of our students of the Technical Courses in Computer Science.

I have a law degree from Unicatólica de Quixadá, a course that enabled me to work as a lawyer for almost 2 years, working in several areas of law, with a postgraduate degree in Electoral Law.

Today I am joining the Data Science, Business Intelligence and Machine Learning area, continuing my career in the Technology area. I'm taking a course in Data Science at AWARI and expanding my studies in Business Intelligence and Machine Learning, SQL and Python at Alura.

I have knowledge in SQL and in several Python packages used in the data area: Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and Numpy. I am studying English at English Live.

So far I've had several experiences that have helped me to develop critical, analytical thinking, a collaborative profile and extremely focused on delivery.
